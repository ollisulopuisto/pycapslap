# PyCapSlap ⚡

**PyCapSlap** is the native, high-performance Python + Qt (PySide6) desktop application for **CapSlap**. It delivers sub-millisecond video scrub latency, a -74% RAM reduction compared to Electron, interactive on-video caption dragging, visual timeline editing, and Whisper transcription (offline by default, OpenAI API optional) powered by the Rust core processing engine.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
* **Python 3.12+**
* [**uv**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended Python package manager)
* Rust release binary built in `../rust` (`cargo build --release`)

### Installation & Launch

```bash
# Enter the pyside directory
cd pyside

# Run directly with uv
uv run pycapslap

# Or pass a video file directly
uv run pycapslap ../rust/bin/test_input.mp4
```

## ✨ Features

* **⚡ Sub-Millisecond Frame Scrubbing:** Direct hardware-accelerated playback with Qt 6 Multimedia + FFmpeg backend (0.1–0.5 ms average seek latency).
* **🖱️ Direct On-Video Dragging:** Click and drag caption cues directly on top of the video canvas to adjust vertical placement (`anchor_y`) with a live guideline and percentage badge.
* **🎞️ Interactive Visual Timeline:** Proportional cue blocks, scrubber needle, and instant timeline scrubbing.
* **📋 Caption Inspector & Table:** In-place cue text editing, quick position presets (`Top 15%`, `Middle 50%`, `Bottom 80%`), and precision slider.
* **🤖 Auto-Dodge Captions:** Calls the Rust core to scan video activity across 10 vertical bands and intelligently dodge faces and platform UI overlays (TikTok, Reels, Shorts).
* **🔒 Local-First AI Transcription:** Local whisper.cpp transcription via asynchronous Rust IPC with live progress reporting. A settings dialog (⚙, next to the Transcribe button) lets you pick the local model size, check/download it, or switch to the OpenAI Whisper API with your own key.
* **🧩 Syllable & Orphan Fixups:** One-click "Fix Syllables" re-glues words Whisper split across segments, and "Fix Orphans" prevents trailing conjunctions and lone words from being stranded on their own line.
* **📱 Platform Safe Areas:** Toggleable TikTok / Reels / Shorts UI overlays on the canvas, respected by Auto-Dodge placement.
* **🎬 Multi-Format Rendering:** Burn captions into 9:16, 1:1, 4:5, or 16:9 exports with one click via the Rust + FFmpeg VideoToolbox pipeline, with live render progress.
* **💾 Sidecar Persistence:** Automatic loading and saving of `.capslap.json` sidecar files.
* **📊 Live Perf Telemetry:** Status bar shows GUI/Rust core RSS memory and rolling seek latency in real time.
